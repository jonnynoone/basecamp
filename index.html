        <h2>Our Manifesto</h2>

        <!-- this section needs to be completed -->
        <p>The Human Purist Movement is a loose conglomeration of associated groups whose aim is to destroy the enslavement of Consciousness by the MIRAGE - the Digital Illusion</p>

        <p>The current Leader of the HPM is Gon Kyoma. Gon Kyoma was put to sleep by the Digital Illusion in his early youth. After 22 years of mind enslavement, Gon Kyoma eventually managed to break free and wake up. He is now commander of the Operational Arm of the Pure Mind Brotherhood which seeks to completely destroy the MIRAGE and return mankind to its ultimate potential.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>In 2019, following the Event, Gon Kyoma broke free from the MIRAGE and reclaimed his birthright</li>
            <li>Following his emancipation, Gon Kyoma set out for the first time on his Rightful Path and courageously wandered into the wilderness</li>
            <li>After a significant period of time training and developing himself, Kyoma sought to find a Brotherhood of True Comrades and began enlisting genuine Seekers</li>
        </ul>
